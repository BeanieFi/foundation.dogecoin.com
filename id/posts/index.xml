We wanted to address this:
Several months ago (noting while an earlier post stated a year, first confirmed mention is April) Binance notified us they had cases where transactions were stuck, meaning they were not being mined successfully. We suggested Binance use RBF (replace by fee) on these transactions, which would replace the original transactions with a new transaction with a higher fee paid.</description></item></channel></rss>
